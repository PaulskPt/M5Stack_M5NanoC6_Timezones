Board: M5Stack M5NanoC6 with connected to GROVE Port: OLED and RTC units

Arduino IDE v2.3.3

Sketch: M5NanoC6_Timezones_with_OLED_and_RTC_units.ino

Note: just finished adding functionality to WiFi connect to my mobile phone. 
      It worked immediately.
	  Added global boolean variable: wait_until_sntp_notification_cb. This variable is set in function time_sync_notification_cb()
	  It is reset in loop(). The idea is, at startup, that everything will wait until this global variable has been set.

Note: to prevent 100% memory usage, I deleted some functions. Deleted all if (my_debug){...} blocks;
      used "static constexpr const" and "PROGMEM" directives to try to move variables to program memory.


Monitor output (partially):

Note: I switched of the WiFi of the mobile phone. The following monitor output occurred:

19:47:52.474 -> trying to connect WiFi to mobile phone 
19:47:52.474 -> E (1000191) wifi:sta is connecting, return error
19:48:02.487 -> trying to connect WiFi to fixed AP
19:48:02.487 -> E (1010211) wifi:sta is connecting, return error
19:48:07.305 ->

19:48:08.310 -> printLocalTime(): Timezone: Europe/Lisbon, datetime: Tuesday, October 15 2024 19:48:09 zone WEST +0100 


Note: conclusion: the switching from mobile WiFi to fixed WiFi works OK!
